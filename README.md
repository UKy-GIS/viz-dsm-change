# Visualizing landscape dynamics

## Surface change detection using multi-temporal DSMs

The KyFromAbove initiative has published abundant high-quality lidar data that has revolutionized our ability to capture and analyze topographic information at unprecedented levels of detail. This talk presents a unique approach to visualizing and quantifying above-ground surface changes using digital surface models (DSMs) derived from temporally distinct point clouds. We use Python, ArcPy, and Map Algebra to demonstrate a robust methodology for analyzing these complex datasets, revealing subtle landscape alterations that were previously challenging to detect and measure.
